    	firefox browser: sudo apt-get install firefox
	splinter: pip install splinter
	geckodriver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver
	lang_detect: pip install langdetect
	ntlk library: conda install -c anaconda nltk 

Usage for model validation: 

main.py data-set.csv [-k] [--size] [-w] [-v] [--nohead]
	-k number of splits for the k-fold cross_validation method
    	--size size of the training set (in case you want to train with less samples (if you dont want to reduce the training set use --size n)
    	-w maximun number of words you want in the dictionary (if you dont want a limited number use -w m)
    	-v will show results on the standard output (if this is not entered the results will be stored in the wd)
    	--nohead to use web crawler on headless version 

Default parameters: -k 5 -w m --size n

Usage for model testing:

main.py data-set.csv --target [-sp] [--nohead] [-rt]
    
    --target the user or hashtag you want to analize (e.g: @Avengers for the user (@Avengers) or Avengers for the hashtag (#Avengers))
    -sp time interval in seconds between crawler scrolls (the slower your internet connection the higher this value must be)
    
    --nohead enter this parameter if you dont want the crawler to open your browser
    -rt will analize the users's retweets as well (this has no effects if you are analyzing a hashtag) 

Default parameters: -sp 0.5
